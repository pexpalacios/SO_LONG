# SO_LONG
42 Milestone 2


So_long is a project where you have to make a small videogame using minilibx as a graphic library (which was an awful expierence lol). You are only allowed to make a simple 2D game that uses the four arrow keys (or WASD) as movement and the sole objective is getting some kind of collectible to open the the exit and get out of the map, completing the game.


### SCREENCAPS

```working on it. stand by ```


### SUBJECT RULES

The maps given to the program must comply with some rules:
- Must be a .ber file
- May only have '0', '1', 'P', 'E' and 'C' as characters, and there must be only one 'P' and 'E'
- It must be a rectangle and be closed by walls
- The player must be able to get every collectible/the game must be "winnable"
